/*
	 * need to include:
	 * 
	 * subraces
	 * 	->should be a sub class of the race they are a subrace of
	 * 
	 * class features
	 * 	->capabilities that set them apart from other classes
	 * 
	 * Proficiencies
	 * 	->armor, weapons, skills, saving throws, tools
	 * 
	 * hit points from hit dice - different classes have different dice for the roll (start with highest roll + constitution modifier)
	 *   ->need to account for constitution modifier as well
	 *   ->need to display hit dice used and number of hit dice per long rest
	 *   
	 *   proficiency bonus
	 *   
	 *   background?
	 *   	->can affect proficiencies
	 *   	->look into more in the book
	 *  
	 *  ability scores
	 *  	->same random roll for everyone, then distribute and add race bonuses.
	 *  	->roll 4 6-sided dice and keep three highest rolls and add together.
	 *  		->do this 6 total times so you have 6 numbers(total of 3 highest)
	 *  	->assign one number to each ability score
	 *  	->add in modifiers from race
	 *  	->determine ability modifiers
	 *  		->table with all possibilities in player's handbook, pull from there for if statements
	 *  	->need to make sure the program defaults the highest score to the most important ability score based on class
	 *  
	 *  name
	 *  	->look into a random name generator **** the book provides example names for each race
	 *  
	 *  description
	 *  	->is it worth including this?
	 *  		->could be useful/fun - would have different description generators for each class and race
	 *  	->height and weight generator with rolls
	 *  	->can look into linking appearance with ability scores(high strength = large and ripped, high dexterity = slim/lithe build, etc...)
	 *  		->GREAT DESCRIPTIONS AND OPTIONS IN HANDBOOK PAGE 14
	 *  alignment
	 *  	->populate list with all options and use a random one
	 *  		->can look into different lists for different classes (paladin = good, warlock = evil, etc...)
	 *  
	 *  ideals, bonds, and flaws
	 *  	->not sure about this, look into more
	 *  
	 *  starting equipment
	 *  	->determined by class and background
	 *  	->one free trinket
	 *  
	 *  armor class
	 *  	->do i want to have it change based on just 10+ dexterity modifier or have it account for shield/armor in starting equipment
	 *  	->need to look into how certain class features affect AC
	 *  
	 *  option to create a party?
	 *  	->enter number of part members, run program that many times
	 *  
	 *  _______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
	 *  
	 *  POSSIBLE EXPANSION IDEAS
	 *  
	 *  option to choose specific class and generate from there? |
	 *  option to choose specific race and generate from there?  | - think about it while working on everything else, might be too hard to 
	 *  option for both?										 |	 implement at a later date. Might be easier to include from the beginning.
	 *  
	 *  option to generate character at set level?
	 * 		->add in all the level up options to each class and give the user the option to generate a character at a specific class with random stuff.
	 *  	
	 * 	fireball? fireball
	 * 		->ask user if they want fireball and give them the fireball spell if available and a scroll of fireball if not
